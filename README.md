# generator
Sprite Generator Project 
Dependencies:

numpy/scipy

tensorflow

Keras


to run my GAN implementation:

`python generator.py`

to run my WGAN implementation:

`python wgan.py`

to run my iWGAN implementation:

`python iwgan.py`

different models can be used by calling different functions from `zoo.py` in order to create the model and load the data.


for an adaptation of the original iwgan implemantion to work with my dataset call

`python gan_sprites.py` from within imporved_wgan directory


the code in the imporved_wgan directory was not wrtitten by me and belongs to the original owner. it was adapted to work with my dataset
